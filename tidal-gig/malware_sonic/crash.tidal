"""
see those sky in the red and bloom
cemetery is my next home
let my hole seal with your fume
check your neck if it's still with chromes

and the chance of this car crash
depends on this car batch
if you fear it will be crashed
they don't care they just want more cash

sex for those who got sixpack
ninetysix for those who read back
symptathy for those who die
no empathy for those who lie

and please come on the runway
to see if you can do it oneway
here the bkk, not LA
100 grand a month is (very) ok
yeh yeh, and that bitches're running
they're CFO, but no funding
if this country is still flying,
(shit) we all know it will go dying
