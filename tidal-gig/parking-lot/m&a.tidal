"""
check your credit
check your pocket
check your debit, bitch

feel like in k-hole
feel like no control
feel like I'm sicko, shit

government will come to you
taxation is only their tool
love is only for trade
will pay debt, if only help me sane

something's crawling on my bed
it's dragging me but I negotiate
sign the contract and leave the room
send me the budget and I will help you consume
